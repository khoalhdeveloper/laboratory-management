Urinalysis Test
================

Description:
A urinalysis is a test that analyzes the physical, chemical, and microscopic components of urine. It helps assess overall health and detect a wide range of medical conditions, kidney infections, kidney disease, and diabetes.

Parameters:

1. Leukocytes (LEU)
   - Description: Measures the presence of white blood cells (leukocytes) in the urine, which can indicate an infection.
   - Normal Range: Negative or 10-25 Leu/µL

2. Nitrite (NIT)
   - Description: Detects nitrites, which are often produced by bacteria, a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI).
   - Normal Range: Negative

3. Protein (PRO)
   - Description: Measures the amount of protein (primarily albumin) in the urine. High levels can indicate kidney problems.
   - Normal Range: Negative or 7.5-20 mg/dL

4. pH
   - Description: Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the urine, which can be affected by diet, medications, or disease.
   - Normal Range: 4.6-8.0

5. Blood (BLD)
   - Description: Detects the presence of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the urine, suggesting potential bleeding or damage.
   - Normal Range: Negative or 0.015-0.062 mg/dL

6. Specific Gravity (SG)
   - Description: Measures the concentration (density) of the urine, indicating hydration status or kidney function.
   - Normal Range: 1.005-1.030

7. Ketones (KET)
   - Description: Measures ketones, substances produced when the body burns fat for energy; high levels can be a sign of uncontrolled diabetes.
   - Normal Range: Negative or 2.5-5 mg/dL

8. Glucose (GLU)
   - Description: Measures the amount of sugar (glucose) in the urine. High levels are commonly a sign of diabetes.
   - Normal Range: Negative or 50-100 mg/dL

Clinical Significance:

- Leukocytes (High): May indicate urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney infection
- Nitrite (Positive): Strong indicator of bacterial UTI
- Protein (High): May indicate kidney disease, diabetes, high blood pressure
- pH (Abnormal): Very low pH may indicate metabolic acidosis; very high pH may suggest UTI
- Blood (Positive): May indicate kidney stones, infection, trauma, or kidney disease
- Specific Gravity (Low): May indicate diabetes insipidus or excess fluid intake
- Specific Gravity (High): May indicate dehydration or heart failure
- Ketones (High): May indicate uncontrolled diabetes, starvation, or low-carb diet
- Glucose (Positive): Strong indicator of diabetes mellitus

When to Test:
- Routine health screening
- Suspected urinary tract infection
- Monitoring kidney disease or diabetes
- Symptoms like frequent urination, pain, or blood in urine
- Pre-operative assessment
