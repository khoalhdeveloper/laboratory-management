Blood Test (Complete Blood Count - CBC)
========================================

Description:
The CBC test measures various components of the blood to help assess overall health and detect medical conditions such as anemia, infection, and many other disorders.

Parameters:

1. White Blood Cell Count (WBC)
   - Description: Measures the number of white blood cells (leukocytes) in the blood, which helps fight infection.
   - Normal Range: 4,000–10,000 cells/µL

2. Red Blood Cell Count (RBC)
   - Description: Measures the number of red blood cells per unit of blood, responsible for carrying oxygen.
   - Normal Range:
     - Male: 4.7–6.1 million/µL
     - Female: 4.2–5.4 million/µL

3. Hemoglobin (Hb/HGB)
   - Description: Protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.
   - Normal Range:
     - Male: 14–18 g/dL
     - Female: 12–16 g/dL

4. Hematocrit (HCT)
   - Description: Percentage of red blood cells in blood volume.
   - Normal Range:
     - Male: 42–52%
     - Female: 37–47%

5. Platelet Count (PLT)
   - Description: Number of platelets in the blood, responsible for clotting.
   - Normal Range: 150,000–350,000 cells/µL

6. Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
   - Description: Average size of red blood cells.
   - Normal Range: 80–100 fL

7. Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)
   - Description: Average amount of hemoglobin per red blood cell.
   - Normal Range: 27–33 pg

8. Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)
   - Description: Average concentration of hemoglobin in red blood cells.
   - Normal Range: 32–36 g/dL

Clinical Significance:

- WBC (High): May indicate infection, inflammation, leukemia, or immune system disorder
- WBC (Low): May indicate bone marrow disorder, autoimmune disease, or viral infection
- RBC (Low): May indicate anemia, bleeding, bone marrow disorder, or nutritional deficiency
- RBC (High): May indicate dehydration, lung disease, or polycythemia
- Hemoglobin (Low): Indicates anemia, may cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath
- Hemoglobin (High): May indicate dehydration, lung disease, or living at high altitude
- Hematocrit (Low): Indicates anemia or blood loss
- Hematocrit (High): May indicate dehydration or polycythemia
- Platelets (Low): May indicate bleeding disorder, bone marrow disorder, or immune system problem
- Platelets (High): May indicate inflammation, infection, or bone marrow disorder
- MCV (Low - Microcytic): Suggests iron deficiency anemia or thalassemia
- MCV (High - Macrocytic): Suggests vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, liver disease, or alcoholism
- MCH (Low): Indicates hypochromic anemia, often with iron deficiency
- MCH (High): May indicate macrocytic anemia
- MCHC (Low): Indicates hypochromic anemia
- MCHC (High): Rare, may indicate hereditary spherocytosis or severe dehydration

Anemia Classification by MCV:
- Microcytic (MCV < 80 fL): Iron deficiency, thalassemia, chronic disease
- Normocytic (MCV 80-100 fL): Acute blood loss, hemolysis, chronic kidney disease
- Macrocytic (MCV > 100 fL): B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, hypothyroidism

When to Test:
- Routine health screening
- Suspected anemia (fatigue, weakness, pale skin)
- Suspected infection (fever, inflammation)
- Monitoring chronic conditions (kidney disease, cancer)
- Pre-operative assessment
- Monitoring treatment effects (chemotherapy, medications)
- Unexplained bruising or bleeding
